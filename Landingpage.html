        If you‚Äôre a beginner to code and just started learning HTML and CSS, you
        may be wondering what practice projects you can do to build your
        portfolio and hone your abilities. You might even ask whether or not you
        can actually do anything with just these two languages! The good news is
        that there are many types of projects out there that beginners can use
        to practice coding, build skills, study, and even start earning money.
        The first website I built ‚Äî the final project of a video lesson series
        on an online coding platform ‚Äî was made purely with HTML and CSS. Even
        though it was a basic static web page for a fake bakery that would never
        be seen or hosted anywhere, I was thrilled. I had created something that
        wasn‚Äôt there before, using code. As an English major, using language in
        this tangible way was new to me, and these languages made it possible.
        The experience motivated me to continue going ‚Äî I‚Äôm still studying
        today, even after years of working as a software engineer. In this
        article we‚Äôll go over how you can also use HTML and CSS to build
        projects and explore the tech industry, even if you‚Äôre just starting
        your journey into the tech space.
